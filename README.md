##### __Me and Yiting are having a group work on pcomp. Our project is about building an art installation in order to remind people say no  to cyber-Violence.__


In today's fickle society, the cost of hurting people is becoming less and less expensive. The internet has brought convenience but also cyber bullying. People hide behind their screens to amplify their malice, attacking or fighting people they don't even know for the sake of their own momentary pleasure.

The aim of this project is to make people better aware that an offhand comment or a seemingly uncritical comment can cause harm to another person, and that this harm stings the other person or the person being commented on like a poisonous thorn.

## **Concept**

Project <Clouds> is an  interactive installation which uses sound and colour changes to demonstrate the psychological and physical effects of online violence. By simply approaching the installation and touching the dangling tag, people can trigger a conversation about online violence. Subsequently, the sound and colour of the clouds will also change.

In our projection, the viewer will have a visual experience of the damage done by online violence. The audience will touch the dangling tag of the installation with their hands to trigger subsequent changes throughout the installation: the lighting will change from a warm orange to a melancholic blue, mean words will be accompanied by bursts of thunder and lightning, and the projection will then project a mask of weeping.


## **The flow chart**

Due to the marking criteria and technical difficult, we cancel the project idea , blue teeth control and Wi-Fi remote control.

## **What we need**

Cotton - build the clouds

Fish line – for dangling the clouds

Box – container of all the boards and components

Arduino board *3 – it’s really a big project (at least looks like

Ultrasonic sensor – to trigger the light (input 1)

NeoPixels - Warm/Cold light (output 1)
                 
Cooper tape – capacitive sensor (input 2)

Colour detector – use lights’ colour changes to trigger the audio player (input 3)

SD Card adaptor, audio player – the mean talk that we found in internet (output 2)

Sounds detector – use loud voice to trigger the lcd screen (input 4)

LCD screen – simple output (output 3)

Servos – create a simple vibration make it looks like raining (output4)


## **Start making!**

In the following section we meet plenty of difficulties and different issues that cause us a lot of trouble.

We have to give up some interesting ideas in order to make it work smoothly. Those ideas will be the part that could improve next time.

< we didn’t choose colour detector since it will take much longer time than the ldr sensor. We change it into ldr in order to give a smoother experience
